This is a Human Resource Management System which has both admin and Emoloyee logins.
The admin page includes the features like adding the departments in the company, adding employees and their info into those departments and filtering the employees based on their salary and departments they work in.
The Employee page can only show the employee info and has the options to punch in and out.

Both the admin and employee routes are protected.

I will work on the project to add many more features.
